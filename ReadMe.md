Resource Spawner Overhaul Forked 0.16.3

This is basically a clone of Dark/orzelek's mod Resource Spawner Overhaul

I have been motivated to fork it purely because I tweaked the vanilla resource
settings some time ago as the original ones were not to my liking, and ever
since have had to edit the mod every time RSO was updated.

This fork purely exists to alleviate my own frustration about having to do this!

This fork is not available from the mod portal as it is really for my own 
private use, and those players who frequent my Factorio servers.

It IS available from my GitHub repository, but, although it is public, is not
intended for widespread use outside my Factorio servers.

For compatibility with the original licence of this mod I am licensing this
fork as Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0)
